# Binary Text Classification with BERT
Accompanying code for the Medium article found at https://medium.com/@chaturangarajapakshe/a-simple-guide-on-using-bert-for-text-classification-bbf041ac8d04.

## Important!

This repository was not meant to be a standalone guide to using BERT. It was originally created to accompany the article above.  
If you are using this repo to set up BERT and you run into any issues, I highly recommend that you go through the article as it explains things in more detail.  
Even if you don't run into problems, the article should give a better picture of how I did things, and why I chose to do it that way. Gaining that perspective may help you to adapt this code to your project in a more suitable and/or efficient manner.

Happy coding!
